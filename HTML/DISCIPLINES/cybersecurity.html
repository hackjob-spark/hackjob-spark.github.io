                    Ever since the start of the modern era, more and more businesses have been utilizing technology. This resulted in new opportunities for businesses to grow and prosper as well as new risks to consider. 
                    Cybersecurity is the application of technologies, 
                    processes, and controls to protect systems, networks, 
                    programs, devices, and data from cyber attacks. 
                    Professionals under this discipline aim to reduce the 
                    risk of cyber attacks, and protect systems, networks, 
                    and technologies against unauthorized exploitation.
